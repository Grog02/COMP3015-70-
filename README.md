### What it was created on
This is an OpenGL project created using Windows 11 and Visual Studio 2022

Follow this file path and run Project_Template.exe

## The Scene

When the .exe file is executed, there will be a snow-covered mountain with Toon Shading and Edge Detection. 
Controls are shown down below for how to navigate it. 

I have chosen Edge Detection as a feature because I was really fascinated to learn how you can find an edge in an image or texture with just code. 

I have also added toon shading to this scene because I think it makes the scene look generally better but as it is a feature from the Coursework 1 labs and it is not very difficult, I will not discuss it very much as the real emphasis is on Edge Detection. 

Edge Detection in OpenGL is involves identifying points in an image or model of some sort and identifies where the colour intensity changes heavily, usually marking boundaries between different objects. 
This process is carried out using shaders. 
Edge detection algorithms apply a filter that calculates the gradient of the image intensity at each pixel, a high gradient indicates a large change in the intensity which implies it is an edge and is marked.

## Controls
W - Move camera forward

A - Move camera left

S - Move camera backward

D - Move camera right

Up Arrow - Move camera up

Down Arrow - Move camera down

Left Click (hold) - Rotate camera and hides mouse cursor

Left Click (release) - resets the mouse cursor position to the middle of the window and shows the cursor
